# MDA_hw1

This project contains a DNA sequence in the fasta format (spades_scaffolds).
There is also a python code that allows you to select contigues of a certain length from a given sequence. Also, the following code allows you to split this file into contigues one by one. This is done for the convenience of evaluation by prokka.
Also in this project there are estimates of BLAST and QUEST.
